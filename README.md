# Generate Hydrogen Kit

A basic tool to generate `drumkit.xml` files for Hydrogen drum machine. Saves a bit of time when making kits.

Supply it with a name and a path to a directory containing WAV files and it will put a `drumkit.xml` in this directory. You can then copy the whole folder to `$HYDROGEN_PATH/drumkits/`.
